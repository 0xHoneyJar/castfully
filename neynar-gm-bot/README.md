# gm_bot

## Introduction

`gm_bot` is an automated messaging bot designed to cast a 'gm ü™ê' message in Warpcast every day at a scheduled time. The bot operates continuously as long as the system remains online. It leverages [Neynar API](https://docs.neynar.com/) and is built using [@neynar/nodejs-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@neynar/nodejs-sdk).

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/): A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.

## Installation

### Setting Up the Environment

1. **Install PM2**: PM2 is a process manager for Node.js applications. Install it globally using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install -g pm2
   ```

2. **Install Project Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and run one of the following commands to install all required dependencies:

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Copy the example environment file:
     ```bash
